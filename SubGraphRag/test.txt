- got subgraphrag running (just slow af)
- continued reading more about knowledge graph and uncertainty / building out library for related works
- also building out my own KG for medical knowledge using like wikiquery and a bunch of open source ones (mostly disease drug interactions)


for next time..?

- just add the monte carlo layer 
- build own knowledge graph completely
