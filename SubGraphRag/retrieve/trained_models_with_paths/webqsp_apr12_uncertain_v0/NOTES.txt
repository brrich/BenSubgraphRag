okay some notes on this one
this was the first go at an uncertainty aware model
it uses several dropout layers with dropout rates between 0.1 and 0.2
it takes the mean value as the actual approximated value. 

I think that its proba  mis-approximation of uncertainty? But it did seem to train. I think it trained slower but eventually got to p much the same
accuracy as the default model. 

Also note I added some layers / complexity to the MLP.
